# 🏡 House Price Prediction Web Application

This project is a Machine Learning-based House Price Prediction System built using Python & Flask.
It allows users to input property details (area, location, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.) and get an estimated house price instantly.
It demonstrates Machine Learning + Full-Stack Development with an interactive frontend, Flask backend, and trained ML models.

---

## ✅ Project Objective

To develop a predictive model that estimates house prices using Supervised Learning Algorithms such as Linear Regression and Random Forest.
The project aims to help users understand the influence of key features like area, location, bedrooms, and bathrooms on house pricing.

## 📚 Core Features

🔹 Data Preprocessing – Cleaning & preparing dataset for ML
🔹 Model Training – Linear Regression & Random Forest Regressor
🔹 Price Prediction – Predicts house prices based on user input
🔹 Interactive UI – User-friendly web interface via Flask
🔹 Model Evaluation – R² Score, MSE, RMSE for performance check
🔹 Deployment Ready – Flask app for easy local deployment

📂 Project Workflow

Data Collection – Import housing dataset (CSV).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understand data with Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

Feature Engineering – Encode categorical variables, handle missing values.

Model Building – Linear Regression & Random Forest.

Model Evaluation – Compare models with R² Score, MSE, RMSE.

Flask Integration – Load saved ML model (model.pkl) and connect with UI.

Frontend – Users input property details, get predicted price.

Deployment – Run locally with Flask, extendable to cloud hosting.

🎯 Uses & Applications

🏘️ Useful for real estate agents, buyers, sellers to estimate fair prices.
📊 Helps in data-driven decision making.
🎓 Great learning project for beginners in Machine Learning + Flask.
💼 Can be extended into a real-world property pricing system.

🔮 Future Enhancements
