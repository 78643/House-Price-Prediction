# 🏡 House Price Prediction Web Application

This project is a Machine Learning-based House Price Prediction System built using Python & Flask.
It allows users to input property details (area, location, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.) and get an estimated house price instantly.
It demonstrates Machine Learning + Full-Stack Development with an interactive frontend, Flask backend, and trained ML models.
